To show real time data start Python server in the directory:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (for Python 2) and `python -m http.serve` (for Python 3)

The html files are using MapBox and therefore a correctly setup MapBox database will be required and an access token correctly added to the slider.html file.
